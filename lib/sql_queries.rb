# Write your sql queries in this file in the appropriate method like the example below:

# Make sure each ruby method returns a string containing a valid SQL statement.

# The ON clause is used to join tables where the column names donâ€™t match in both tables.

# The AS command renames a column or table with an alias.  The alias only exists for the duration of the query.
# The alias requires double quotation marks or square brackets if the alias name contains spaces.

# If a HAVING clause is specified, it is evaluated once for each group of rows as a boolean expression. 
# If the result of evaluating the HAVING clause is false, the group is discarded. 
# If the HAVING clause is an aggregate expression, it is evaluated across all rows in the group. 
# If a HAVING clause is a non-aggregate expression, it is evaluated with respect to an arbitrarily selected row from the group. 
# The HAVING expression may refer to values, even aggregate functions, that are not in the result.
